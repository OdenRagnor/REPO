    <h1 id="intro">Welcome OSINT Analyst!</h1>
    <div id="statement">Let's dive into OSINT!<br><br>First let me thank you for coming to this page. I am Oden, and I have been an OSINT analyst since 2019 and was originally trained on OSINT analysis in 2018. It is a fun and rewarding career. I will be upfront, though this is a great resource for an OSINT analyst this page will not certify you in OSINT analysis. This page is meant as a one stop shop on how to begin conducting OSINT analysis without waiting for an expensive training resource.<br><br>So, the downside of this site is you will become very proficient in OSINT but have no certification to show for it. For that I am sorry, but the bright side is by the time you reach the end of the resources on this page will have all the same knowledge a senior OSINT analyst.<br><br>My plan is to keep this site up to date with the knowledge I gain in my day to day tasks. So if you are looking for a resource today and you can not find it check back in a week or a month and it might just appear.</div>
